Session 2, Assignment 1:
  
1. If the scores for a given sample distribution are: 32 32 35 36 37 38 38 39 39 39 40 40 42 45. Find the Variance and The Standard Deviation.
	Answer: Variance = 12.46 and the Standard Deviation = 3.53

2. The following table shows percent variations of two financial indices, the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange ) and the NASDAQ composite (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation) in 10 consecutive days: 

Day	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
NYS	0.58	0.01	0.43	-0.14	-1.15	0.15	-1.23	-0.88	-1.26	0.08
NAS	0.70	-0.79	0.85	-0.16	-0.71	-0.02	-1.10	-0.77	-0.78	-0.35
 
Use a suitable measure to quantify the dependence between the variations of the two indices and comment on the result.

	Answer: I would suggest finding the Covariance and Correlation between the 2 variables (NYS & NASDAQ).
		
		Covariance = 0.39 (this the measure of how much NYS & NASDAQ vary together)
		Correlation = 0.83 (this is not very far from a perfect relationship (1 being perfect) between NYS & NASDAQ

		The distribution of the data points show that there is a 0.83 correlation between the NYS & NASDAQ.
		So, when the NYS goes up in value, so does the NASDAQ tend to go up in value.
		When the NYS goes down in value, so does the NASDAQ tend to go down in value.
		The covariance is 0.39 in whatever unit of measure is being used.
